  title={Scalable Non-Equivariant 3D Molecule Generation via Rotational Alignment},
  abstract={In this work, we relax the equivariance constraints in existing 3D molecule diffusion models. 
            We use an autoencoder to learn rotations that align the 3D orientations of molecules. 
            Then a non-equivariant diffusion model (e.g., parametrized by a transformer) is trained in 
            the aligned latent space. Our model significantly improves the scalability and efficiency 
            compared with equivariant counterparts, without sacrificing sample quality.},

  title={Recurrent Distance Filtering for Graph Representation Learning},
  abstract={We propose a novel architecture that combines state-space models with GNNs to improve the ability 
            to model long-range dependencies on graphs. Our architecture achieves performance comparable to or 
            better than SOTA graph transformers, even without positional encoding, and significantly 
            reduces the computational cost.},

  title={DiffMG: Differentiable Meta Graph Search for Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks},
  abstract={We propose a neural architecture search method for GNNs on heterogeneous information networks, which learns 
            task-dependent message-passing patterns that incorporate semantic information. Our search algorithm is differentiable, 
            making the search cost comparable to training the derived final model once. Our method has good interpretability 
            and is more efficient than attention-based models.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
