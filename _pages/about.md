I'm a third-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at ETH Zurich. I'm fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Thomas Hofmann](https://da.inf.ethz.ch/).
I'm currently interested in: (1) understanding and designing graph neural networks, (2) generative modeling for structured data from scientific domains (e.g., molecules).

Previously, I obtained my MPhil from HKUST, advised by [Prof. Tong Zhang](https://tongzhang-ml.org) and [Prof. Quanming Yao](https://lars-group.github.io). Before that, I obtained my bachelor's degree in computer science from Tsinghua University, where I worked with [Prof. Jie Tang](https://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/jietang).
